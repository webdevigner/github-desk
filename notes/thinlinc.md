*thinlinc with tailscale*

I am trying to gain remote access to my home machine via Thinlinc through Tailscale.
It works fine on local network. But when I move to an external network,
I canâ€™t access my home machine using Thinlinc. SSH works fine and I have accessed my machine via SSH just fine

Note that ThinLinc connections are a two-step process.
First the client establishes a connection to the ssh address you state in the connection form.
But once connected, the ThinLinc server replies with the address where the client should actually connect to.
In a simple setup this is the address the ThinLinc server itself thinks it has.
So it is important to make them match up.

/vsmagent/master_hostname

    This parameter specifies the hostname of the master machine,
i.e. the machine that runs the VSM server.
In a HA setup, this should be the hostname of the IP address
that is on the machine that is currently the active node,
to ensure that services on the agents that need to access
the VSM Server always connects to the machine that is up and running.


1. go to /opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d

2. `sudo nano vsmagent.hconf`

**edit master_hostname with ip adress from tailscale**

##The host that runs the VSM server (master machine)##
master_hostname=-*

3. `systemctl restart vsmagent`
